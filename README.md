# LaserGun-Multishot
Laser Gun that fires more than one beam at the same time C# script for unity

This asset was created for my game called SolidLight, but I stopped working on the game and decided to just publish the script that was used to creat the laser gun.

The game was originally inspired by the LIDAR game, you can find my devlogs when I was working on the game on my channel here is the latest devlog: https://youtu.be/OmnI1CupCYQ

Any way here is the description that I was going to use on the game:

SolidLight

The game is based on a hypothetical material called Solid light; in this game you can use your LASER-GUN to turn the surface the light hit into a solid photonic matter which emits light, so you can see in the dark. 

The story of the game is still in preparation, but about the gameplay it would probably be as the following: there will be two options for gameplay, you either play with friends online or you play against an AI, when you spawn you're gonna have the Laser-Gun with you to light your way into the dark, the enemy is an invisible figure which can only be seen from it's shadow casted by the Laser-Gun. Your objective is to survive (again I might add more to the gameplay). 

The plans might change in the future but this is what I'm currently working on. 

New things: 

1)  Added new features to the Lase-Gun such as: 

a)  Added new colors (red, blue, green, purple); this was add for the potential the game multiplayer, when each player spawn they will have their own color; also you can change your color in singleplayer mode each time you press "H" (might change in the future).

 b)  Now you can control the laser spread amount; which is the angel the lasers get shot from, by using the "mouse scroll wheel", and the pitch of the sound will change accordingly with the spread amount or in other words the laser concentration amount (there are 20 levels of spread amount).

 2) Created a new map for the game (still under construction).

 3) Now you can see through solid objects which means that if you light up an area behind a wall you will still see it (which gives you some kind of lidar scanning effect). 

Improvements: 

1) Previously, when you shoot the laser while moving, the position where the laser gets shot from (the muzzle) wouldn't follow the player, so it would appear that the laser is getting shot from the wrong position, but now it's fixed; so they will follow you.

 2) Some laser beam sounds looping errors, now they loop smoothly. 

What's next: 

1) Adding multiplayer.

 2) Adding the enemy.

 3) Finishing the map.

 4) Improving the UI. 

 5) Building the story for singleplayer mode.

 Thing I might add: 

 1) Making it possible for players to build their own maps using Unity and play my game in their own maps. 



- Solid light, often referred to in media as "hard light" or "hard-light", is a hypothetical material, made of light in a solidified state. It has been theorized that this could exist, and experiments claim to have created solid photonic matter or molecules by inducing strong interaction between photons. Potential applications of this could include logic gates for quantum computers and room-temperature superconductor development.
